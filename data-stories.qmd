Communicating the findings from a data analysis is fairly standard, however explaining the full data journey to an audience is a relatively new area within the data field; enter Data Stories. The goal of a data story is to share the process, methods, analysis, and findings in a reproducible approach. Data Chef data stories are geared for a wide range of users, but lean on the more technical side, consisting of code snippets (note the code is not intended to be *production quality*, meaning considerations around optimization, testing, validation, etc. are not the main focus). The focus of these stories are to illustrate approaches for using data and analytics techniques to support informed decisions.
