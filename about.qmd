Data and analytics are becoming important aspects in more organizations, with many making significant investments in the data domain. Utilizing data and analytics can help organizations or any size and from all industries. However, the implementation and transformation toward a *data driven* organization has tended to focus on needs of large tech-based organizations. Much of the data transformation journey has focused on highly technical areas like big data, real-time data streaming, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. While extremely important, powerful, and important, not all organizations require the bleeding edge of data analytics. This over emphasis has made it very difficult for smaller organizations, or those early in their data maturity to implement data analytics into their organizational culture.
