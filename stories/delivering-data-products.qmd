Halifax International Airport Authority (HIAA) transformed its data analytics capabilities with the implementation of Posit Connect, adopting a rapid prototyping approach to deliver user-focused products in record time. This shift enabled the development of a centralized, self-serve Data Analytics Hub, expanding content from two dashboards to interactive applications, dynamic dashboards, and a knowledge center. The platform integrates seamlessly with the existing data infrastructure and Microsoft Teams, enhancing accessibility and collaboration. Key benefits include streamlined operations, significant time savings, data-driven decision-making, and insights into ROI for programs and services. HIAA replaced disconnected, costly, and inefficient solutions with a code-first, iterative methodology powered by R's robust libraries, allowing for visually engaging and interactive tools like Shiny apps and dashboards. The platform provides real-time data access for diverse users, from operational teams to senior executives, enabling efficient planning and recovery post-pandemic.
