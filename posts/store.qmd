The final stage in a food's supply chain journey is storage. A number of options are available (i.e. market, grocery store, warehouse, etc.) each designed and suited for different food choices. Following the example of the apple from previous posts, a bag of frozen apple slices would be better suited for a grocery store or warehouse, rather than a farmer's market.

The data equivalent is **data storage** within the area of data engineering. Selecting a data storage system that is not inline with the intended use case can introduce significant limitations and challenges. When deciding on a data storage system there are a number of factors to consider, such as:

- cloud or on-premise or hybrid
- enterprise or local
- structured or unstructured
- database or file
- row or columnar
